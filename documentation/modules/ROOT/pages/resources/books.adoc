== Red Hat Universal Base Images (UBI) Book

image::book.png[Red Hat Universal Base Images (UBI) book, 200]

As a developer, you need a source of container base images that have many of the qualities of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, but that can be consumed by your users/customers without acquiring a Red Hat subscription. Red Hat provides this with Universal Base Images (UBI), a subset of Red Hat Enterprise Linux for building applications in containers - whatâ€™s different is they have their own unique EULA which means they are freely redistributable.
